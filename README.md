   The Customer-Service-API project is a web-based API that provides a set of endpoints to perform CRUD operations on customer service-related data.

for create -> /create

for fetch All Data -> /get

for getByID -> /get/(id)

for OrderedBy_cibilScore -> /cibil

for deleteByID -> /delete/id

  This endpoints helps to run the application without any circumstances....while running the application do not miss to add /customer as baseuri.
  because it is the context path add in the request url and it is mandotory for all the methods.
